Hello, Mars
============

Introduction
------------

This is a **CommonMark** file, rendered as *HTML*.

Luckily, __CommonMark__ is going away.

_**Hip hip!**_\
*__Hooray!__*\
__*Hip hip!*__\
**_Hooray!_**

There are several reasons why we are going to light Arvo's CommonMark code on fire and throw it out the window:

1. It's horrible
2.  It's so horrible
3.   It's an offense to humanity that it actually exists
4.    How can there be this much syntax?

Luckily, we have some options:

* Light it all on fire
*  Start over from scratch
*   Fire the whole team if ours is as bad
